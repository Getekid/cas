phpbb3-CAS-Auth-plugin
======================

A plugin to enable phpCAS Authentication for phpbb 3.1.x
----------------
Adding this extention to your phpBB3 forum will enable phpCAS Authentication for your board.  
**This is NOT a phpbb MOD**. In phpbb 3.1.x all the modifications to the board are made through extentions.  
   
In order to install it:

1.  Download the zip
2.  Extract it's contents in the root/ext directory of your phpbb3 installation (the "getekid" folder must the one in the ext directory)
3.  Login to the ACP of your forum
4.  Go to the "Customize" tab
5.  Enable the extention (click confirm when asked)
6.  Go to the "General" tab
7.  Click on "Authentication" under "Client Communication". Cas should be available in the dropdown list.
8.  Select "Cas" and add the CAS data of your server (click Submit when finished entering the data)

**Please note:** The plugin is still in alpha stage of development, no login methods have been introduced yet thus no actual functionality is expected.
